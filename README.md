# Chapter3-DataScience
In this chapter, we will leverage a dataset for tasks involving data visualization, data modeling, and the comparison/explanation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Background
HR professionals are usually lacking in analytics and data visualization competence. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano set out to construct their own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of the graduate MSHRM courses at New England College of Business called HR Metrics and Analytics. He created this data set. We will evaluate the data and create various prediction models using the data set.

## Dataset
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rietaros/kampus_merdeka/main/HRDataset_v14.csv


## Task
1. Answer multiple aggregations questions using Pandas. (please refer to .ipynb for detailed questions)
2. Perform EDA on the target to find out how many feature variables are related to the termination of an employee's employment. (Most reasons, by department, by gender, etc.) Create data visualization according to EDA Steps (minimum 5 visualizations). Give us an insight from this step.
3. Perform Machine Learning modeling to predict employee termination.
4. Answer this question:
    a. Is there any relationship between who a person works for (their manager) and their performance score?
    b. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a low ratio of termination?

On this project, I am using Pandas to processing and manipulate data from a dataset. I am also using Seaborn to visualization data in order to observe correlations between every column of the dataset. After that, I will use this dataset to create a machine learning prediction model.
